# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the FVM, be sure your PR follows these rules:
* It follows the [instruction set](https://github.com/flower/fvm/blob/master/INSTRUCTION_SET.md).
* You have a link to a [codepad paste](http://codepad.org/) of your new code in action.
* You have any Bytecode/Hex examples in the `examples/` directory.
* If it doesn't change in C code, i.e., Documentation/Typos, put `[ci skip]` in the title.

## Setting up
Setup is as easy as..1..2..3!
```shell
git clone https://github.com/flower/fvm
